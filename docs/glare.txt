Glare is a PITA.

Although configuration of ISDN links can be done to minimize glare, to be pedantic we must have a clear policy
on how the FreeTDM API is supposed to behave on glare across signaling modules.

There is a well-known race in the FreeTDM API since the beginning. When a user wants to place a call there is 2 APIs that
must be used:

1. ftdm_channel_open_xx (to hunt the channel by group, span or select a channel individually)
2. ftdm_channel_call_place() to place the actual call.

Since the user has no access to channel locking, between opening a channel and placing a call, an incoming call could be
received. Therefore the user needs to be aware of the following:

1. Between ftdm_channel_open_xx and ftdm_channel_call_place() a SIGEVENT_START can be received, if the user application
is smart enough, upon receive of SIGEVENT_START it can avoid doing anything else with the channel (from an outgoing call perspective) 
since that channel is now a channel owned by the incoming call. It can for example hunt another channel using 
ftdm_channel_open_xx again and avoid calling ftdm_channel_call_place. However, if the app is not smart enough and still calls
ftdm_channel_call_place even though already received FTDM_SIGEVENT_START on that channel, ftdm_channel_call_place will return
FTDM_BREAK to inform the user the outgoing call could not be placed and that there is already an incoming call on that channel.

2. If SIGEVENT_START was not received before calling ftdm_channel_call_place, it could still come while ftdm_channel_call_place()
is being executed, in such situation ftdm_channel_place_call() will return FTDM_BREAK to inform the user the call could
not be placed due to glare and the incoming call won the channel, he user should back off since the channel is
now owned by the incoming call (it can touch the channel having in mind there is now an incoming call on it)

3. After ftdm_channel_call_place returns, if glare is detected and the signaling stack decides to drop the local call, a regular
SIGEVENT_STOP will be sent with the hangup cause FTDM_CAUSE_REQUESTED_CHAN_UNAVAIL.
